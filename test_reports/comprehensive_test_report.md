- Missing Lines: 391
- Coverage Percentage: 27%

## Test Configuration
- Using pytest with Django integration
- Async testing enabled
- Coverage reporting configured
- Database migrations disabled for tests

## Recommendations
1. Implement Tests for:
   - WebSocket consumers
   - API serializers
   - View functions
   - Middleware components
   - URL routing

2. Increase Coverage:
   - Add integration tests
   - Add API endpoint tests
   - Add WebSocket connection tests

3. Performance Testing:
   - Add load tests for WebSocket connections
   - Test notification delivery under high load
   - Measure database query performance

4. Security Testing:
   - Test authentication mechanisms
   - Verify authorization rules
   - Test input validation
   - Check for common vulnerabilities

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize testing of core functionality:
   - WebSocket communication
   - Real-time notification delivery
   - User preference management

2. Implement end-to-end tests:
   - User notification flow
   - Preference updates
   - Real-time updates

3. Setup continuous integration:
   - Automated test runs
   - Coverage reports
   - Performance benchmarks
